\<\<\<\<\<\<\< HEAD \#\# Introduction ======= \#\#\# Motivation

Childhood obesity is a major concern in the United States. In nowadays,
obesity is putting children and adolescents at risk for poor health.
Obesity prevalence among children and adolescents is very high.
According to the CDC website, obesity prevalence was 13.9% among 2- to
5-year-olds, 18.4% among 6- to 11-year-olds, and 20.6% among 12- to
19-year-olds. Childhood obesity is also more common among certain
populations.

### Intended Final Prodcut

Our project title is **Student Weight Status in New York State**. In the
final project, we intend to answer the following questions:

1.  How student weight changes in New York state by location?

2.  What is the relationship between the student’s weight and school
    year?

3.  Is the student’s obesity status related to the adult’s obesity
    status?how?

4.  The association between student weight and their race and
    socioeconomic status.

5.  How has the student’s weight changed over time in New York?

### Planned analyses & coding challenges

During the project, we may meet several coding challenges:

1.  The location code in the original dataset is not consistent, thus we
    need to include another dataset with coordinates in order to
    visualize the association between obesity trend and location.

2.  We also want to know whether obesity has correlation with economic
    status so we need another dataset with economic information to
    create the association.

3.  Grade level in the original dataset is in text format, in order to
    see the association with obesity, we need to convert it to factor
    format first.

4.  We planned to use linear regression model to analysis the
    association between obesity rate and other variables like sex, grade
    level, economic status, etc. The resulting model can give us a sense
    of which factor influences obesity rate the most.

### Anticipated Data Source

Our major data source is from health.data.ny.gov. We also used data from
ODS to find the longitude and latitude for each city in NY. We will add
additional data as we go along with the project.
