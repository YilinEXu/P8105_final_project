## Project motivation

Childhood obesity is a major concern in the United States. In nowadays, obesity is putting children and adolescents at risk for poor health. Obesity prevalence among children and adolescents is very high. According to the CDC website, obesity prevalence was 13.9% among 2- to 5-year-old, 18.4% among 6- to 11-year-old, and 20.6% among 12- to 19-year-old. 

The harms of obesity in adolescents exhibit in both physical and psychological aspects. Expression of obesity in children and adolescents is often indicated by weight gain and having a large amount of fat deposition. The increase in body fat will result in increases in body burden and oxygen consumption, which explains why obese children consume more oxygen than people who maintain a healthy weight. Obesity also causes them to be heavy, slow, and unable to move. Many children and adolescents often have flat feet, knee flexion, lower limb flexion, spine, and intervertebral cartilage damage due to obesity. Obese children and adolescents with high cholesterol levels are also at the risk of having a compromised immune system. Some study also shows that obesity is a risk factor of depression.

Therefore, we conducted this study on the obesity situation of students in elementary and middle/high school from 2010 to 2019 to investigate the geographic and time pattern obesity distribution, as well as several potential risk factors that are related to obesity in students.
