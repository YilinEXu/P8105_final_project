<p>We planned to use a linear regression model to analyze the association between obesity rate and other variables like sex, grade level, economic status, etc. The resulting model can give us a sense of which factor influences obesity rate in students from elementary to middle/high school the most.</p>
<p> </p>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The main data set for our project is a data set from The Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (SWSCR). SWSCR collects weight status category data and includes separate estimates of the percent of students overweight, obese and overweight or obese for all reportable grades within the county and/or region and by grade groups (elementary and middle/high). It can be accessed at <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Student-Weight-Status-Category-Reporting-Results-B/es3k-2aus">here</a>. This dataset has a range from 2010 to 2019.</p>
<p>We also combined three extra datasets to examine the factors of economic status, food access ability, and racial difference on weight status. Economic status dataset can be accessed <a href="https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=/EBI/PHIG/apps/chir_dashboard/chir_dashboard&amp;p=it&amp;ind_id=Ng100">here</a>. Food access ability dataset can be accessed <a href="https://webbi1.health.ny.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_program=/EBI/PHIG/apps/chir_dashboard/chir_dashboard&amp;p=it&amp;ind_id=Ng123">here</a>. Race dataset can be accessed <a href="https://labor.ny.gov/stats/nys/statewide-population-data.shtm">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Basic variables that we are interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sex</strong>: Female and male</li>
<li><strong>Grade Level</strong>: Elementary, Middle/High</li>
<li><strong>Weight Status</strong>: Underweight, health weight, overweight or obese based on BMI for age percentile. For this project, we focus on the overweight or obese student percentage which are estimates of based on all reportable grades within the county and/or region and by grade groups.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Status</strong>: Median income in different counties</li>
<li><strong>Food Access Ability</strong>: Food insecurity percentage in different counties</li>
<li><strong>Race</strong>: African American and Caucasians</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<div id="sex" class="section level2">
<h2>Sex</h2>
<p>The graph below shows that male student tend to have higher overweight or obese percentage than female students, and their distribution of higher percentage of overweight or obese is slightly more than female students. There might also be an increase in female’s overweight or obese percentage and a decrease in male’s overweight or obese percentage. However, overall the ratio difference is not obvious.</p>

<h2>Correlation graph</h2>
<p>Before proceeding, it is important to assess crude correlation among relevant variables, in case issues of multicollinearity arise during model development.</p>
<p><img src="raw_regression_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Of relevance to our hypotheses, the following variables were highly correlated and thus may not be accurately interpreted in a model as independent predictors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>white</code> and <code>black</code> (<em>r</em> = -0.96)</li>
<li><code>median_income</code> and <code>food_insecurity_p</code> (<em>r</em> = -0.93)</li>
</ul>
<p>If only focusing on the correlation values between each predictor and the outcome of interest, we might predict that <code>food_insecurity_p</code>and <code>white</code> have positive correlations with <code>percent_overweight_or_obese</code>, while <code>sex</code>, <code>median_income</code>, and <code>black</code> have negative correlations with <code>percent_overweight_or_obese</code>.</p>
